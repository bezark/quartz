Playtest [Many Worlds Game/version/2]({{< ref "Many Worlds Game/version/2" >}}) #game/dev/playtest


  + _What were you expecting?_

    + Decent storytelling. Cards that built off each other.

    + I was expecting to create a sense of history and change over time.

    + I was expecting complications from the cards. Feeling like they didn't make sense or add up.

  + _What was the result?_

    + I was actually surprised by how well [[Benny]] responded to it. I didn't think that the game was particularly polished or ready, but they really liked a lot of the mechanics.

    + I think that there was a pretty good sense of story that began to emerge in the society over time.

    + I think one thing that was maybe missing was a narrative hook or stakes. It seems like it was a little difficult to orient yourself in the world.

    + I wonder if perhaps creating an identity would help with that- leaning into who you are and what you want.
      + there's a bit of strategy to consider by revealing or not revealing too much though.

    + We told a pretty fun story about a world that changed over time. The game was over in one lifetime.

  + _What did you learn?_

    + I think I learned again what the value is of having world building prompts clearly articulated at the outset.

      + It felt hard to dive in - where do you start? What is the world that we live in? That sort of thing.

    + I think I also learned that some of the categories felt a little weird. Material
 for instance didn't really seem to fint in with the others.

    + I learned that pairing the cards with the trends worked mechanically but felt a little weird narratively. Perhaps there are different mechanics for figuring out what happens to a trend over time.
      + Maybe voting a certain number of cubes and then then following through

  + _What didn't go accorindg to plan_

    + I think the beginning didn't go according to plan.

    + I also noticed that the deck was being pretty heavily impacted by my objective. Which was good, but there was little in the way of stopping me from doing that.

    + 

Process so far

  + _What mode have you been in?_

    + I think i've been fairly loose. I've enjoyed taking my time with this iteration.

    + I still feel very card focused.

    + and I try to tie all these systems together. Trying to link and backlink and 'carryForward' etc.

    + I have also been slow and shy to publicly expand and playtest wider audiences.

      + But that is also born out of taking my time. not tushing the process and only testing what I need.

    + I would really like with this next test though to genuinely expand the player count and not be involved in the playing of the game.

    +
