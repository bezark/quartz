      + Your starting conditions

  + The World Stage
    + The central play space.

    + Has places for

Sequence

  + World building with Systems and Entropy

    + Initial

      + Create the world setting

      + Come up with values

    + Invent systems

      + How they bring people together

      + What techniques they use

      + What negative byproducts do they produce

      + What is their slogan

      + Decide their

        + emisary (group)

        + place and thing? #review

    + Articulate Problems

      + Entropy Creates 3 problems #review

        + What else doe entropy do?

    + Create Artifacts

      + Build literal map

      + Record Material

      + Put on costumes

    + Tell the story of the world (make intro video)

  + Round Sequence

    + Human Introduction

      + A player enters

      + They watch The Story so Far


      + Character creation

        + They invent stuff? #review

    + Human phase

      + Human enters The World Stage


      + 3 Eras

        + Human Acts

          + Systems each propose one action. They make the case for solving a problem

          + Humans may try to solve a problem or make it worse

          + Problem Solving

            + Human annoucnes the problem they are trying to solve

            + 1 System can back the action

            + Humans roll a dice

            + System backing increases odds (gives advantage)

            + Roll a D6

              + 1-2 Nothing changes

              + 3-4 it gets slightly better

                + remove an entropy token

                + system may add presence if there is space

                + no byproducts

              + 5-6 it's a success

                + Aspect is transformed and system moves in- may replace a presence

                + Byproduct is given to entropy

            + Resolution

              + The event plays out in 3 sentences

              + The human says one sentence and does one action

              + The target says one sentence and does one action

              + The decider says one final sentence and takes one action

            + If the human was backed by a system they gain an impact from the system. If they failed a challenge, they gain an impact from entropy

        + Entropy Acts

          + Entropy tokens increase on all problems

          + If a problem were to gain a fourth token it instead errupts into crisis

            + Entropy Transforms the attached aspect

              + they remove all presence originally on the aspect

              + they distribute any accumulated byproducts onto the aspect

                + the corresponding system gains points #review

            + Film the crisis in 2 sentences

          + Entropy may Spend a byproduct to

            + Add an entropy token to a problem (only up to three- cannot trigger crisis)

            + Split a problem into two- change an existing problem and create a new one. redistribute the tokens from the first one to the two new problems. Add  the spent byproduct to the new problem.

      + After 3 Actions Human Leaves

        + descendent

        + They may join the system or entropy that has impacted them the most.

    + Systems act

      + Spends any left over tokens. May hold onto them

        + 1- spread - gain a point

        + 2 - spread replace and spread

        + 4- Transform! Gain 5 points

          + change byproduct

    + Entropy may spend byproducts

      + 1 byproduct creates a new problem

      + 1 byproduct can accelerate and existing problem but only up to two tokens.

Things

  + Entropy spends one byproduct to make a problem

    + if the problem comes to pass, the influence must be dispersed and that system gains points

  + No more than 4 problems at once

  + Problems automatically get worse

  + Byproducts can be invested to speed up problems #review

    + Once per turn

  + Whenever a problem gets worse, entropy describes how

  + Crisis

    + A 3 line scene

    + Transform the aspect

    + remove existing influence and distribute cached influence

  + Entropy gains byproducts whenver

    + A system spreads

    + A system reinforces it self

    + A system creates a new thing

  + Dice rolls

    + 1-2 Nothing

    + 3-4 It gets slightly better

      + remove a cube

      + place influence on perm

      + no byproduct
